# Overview

A compiler/tooling project for the Proto programming language. This project is a side project I (Joshua Pepple) am working on long-term. I intend to learn as much about compiler theory as I can using this project as my outlet for learning.

<br>

# Tools

This project will come with a few tools:

1. `prc`, the proto compiler. It is the standalone compiler and can be used to compile a proto source file (with .pr extension) to an executable.

2. `porter`, the project manager for proto. It will be able to:

   - [ ] create new projects from scratch

   - [ ] compile proto projects

   - [ ] fetch proto `units` from GitHub or else where for project use.
