# Overview

A compiler/tooling project for the Proto programming language. This project is a side project that I plan to work on long-term. I intend to learn as much about compiler theory as I can using this project as my outlet for learning. I am inspired by the work of the Zig team, Jonathan Blow on Jai (hopefully it will be available for public use in the near future) and the fun I am having learning and writing Rust.

# Tools

This project will come with a few tools:

1. `prc`, the proto compiler. It is the standalone compiler and can be used to compile a proto source file (with .pr extension) to an executable.

2. `proto`, the REPL for trying out ideas in a less permanent space. I don't think this needs much more explanation.

3. `porter`, the project manager for proto. It will be able to:

   - [ ] create new projects from scratch

   - [ ] compile proto projects

   - [ ] fetch proto `units` from GitHub or else where for project use.

4. `prose`, the documentation generator for proto.
