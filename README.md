# Overview

A compiler/tooling project for the Proto programming language. This project is a side project that I plan to work on long-term. I intend to learn as much about compiler theory as I can using this project as my outlet for learning. I am inspired by the work of the Zig team, Jonathan Blow on Jai (hopefully it will be available for public use in the near future) and the fun I am having learning and writing Rust.

# Language Description

The language description can be found [here](docs/language_desc.md).

# Tools

This project will come with a few tools:

1. [prc](src/prc/README.md), the proto compiler.

2. [proto](src/proto/README.md), the REPL for trying out ideas in a less permanent space. I don't think this needs much more explanation.

3. [porter](src/porter/README.md), the project manager for proto.

4. [prose](src/prose/README.md), the documentation generator for proto.
