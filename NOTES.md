# Improvements for 0.0.1
- Prevent use of array types without size in some receiver contexts (function parameters, struct members) [DONE]
- Add support for method calls on builtin types (Option, Array, Slice, String). [DONE]
- Do type rewrite to stop using the same shape for every damn type. I thought I was cool but I was just an architecture astronaut. Note to self: just do the simple fucking thing until there is concrete proof that a more complex solution is required. [DONE]
- Fix string interpolation involving str literals (which are const char arrays) in C++. Pass them through proto_str. Which would require differentiating between string expressions and the string parts of interpolated strings. [DONE]
- Make members of builtins (Optional, Array, Slice) static instead of per
check instantiation.
- For literals like Strings, Slices, Arrays and Optional, instead of just generating the literal in C++, wrap it with the actual type. This will mean these expression nodes will carry their type with them. So the literals can be used in any instance (like printing a `some a` where a is an array) without a complaint about knowing the type to use.
- Add support for structs.
- Add support for traits.
- Work on out of order declarations.
- Determine how exactly types propagate top down in expr essions. Fix inconsistencies.
- Mutable/const function parameters
- Work on pointers and references.
- Write something for blog about journey so far (lexer, parser, seman and codegen).
- Can SourceRef be made smaller, without importing error reporting?
- Improve error reporting. Instead of current style, maybe allow combining multiple string sources from different sources to provide more information in errors.
- Work on some type of support for variadic functions (using slices?). Is it really needed?
- Work on recoverable errors in parser.
- Work on some type of support for generic types and functions.
- Function overloading?
- Write something for blog about progress since last post.
- Understand the implications of using smart pointers to deal with auto deallocation vs not.
- Work on support for allocators (explicit or implicitly through context passing).
- Can we avoid runtime pointer errors by combining lexical analysis with smart pointers, allocators and Option type.
- Work on function call stack (maybe using context passing?)
- Add panic(), and todo() statements.
- Support for enums.
- Look into supporting functions as first call expressions/types.
- LSP support in zed
- LSP support in vscode
- Look into comments and how they encapsulate code. To be used for doc strings
- Std Lib?
- Tests?
- Modules?
- proto testing framework built in language?
- Notebook support? ðŸ‘€
- 0.0.1 release?
