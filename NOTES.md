# Improvements for 0.0.1
- Prevent use of array types without size in some receiver contexts (function parameters, struct members) [DONE]
- Add support for method calls on builtin types (Option, Array, Slice, String).
- Determine how exactly types propagate top down in expressions. Fix inconsistencies.
- Mutable/const function parameters
- Write something for blog about journey so far (lexer, parser, seman and codegen).
- Work on some type of support for variadic functions (using slices?).
- Work on recoverable errors in parser.
- Work on some type of support for generic types and functions.
- Function overloading?
- Understand the implications of using smart pointers to deal with auto deallocation vs not.
- Work on support for allocators (explicit or implicitly through context passing).
- Can we avoid runtime pointer errors by combining lexical analysis with smart pointers, allocators and Option type.
- Work on function call stack (maybe using context passing?)
- Add panic(), and todo().
- Support for enums.
- Look into supporting functions as first call expressions/types.
- LSP support in zed
- LSP support in vscode
- Look into comments and how they encapsulate code. To be used for doc strings
- Std Lib?
- Tests?
- Modules?
- proto testing framework built in language?
- Notebook support? ðŸ‘€
- 0.0.1 release?
